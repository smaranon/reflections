/**QUESTION 1**/
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you are the only one workng on a project you might want to keep most of your files
remotely that way others can access them.
Also if you have different computer such as a home and/or work computer and you are
contastly working in different places.
