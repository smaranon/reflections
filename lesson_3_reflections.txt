/**QUESTION 1**/
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you are the only one workng on a project you might want to keep most of your files
remotely that way others can access them.
Also if you have different computer such as a home and/or work computer and you are
contastly working in different places.

/**QUESTION 2**/
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because someone else might be working on the same feature that I am currently working
so I would not want to automatically sync any changes to my local repository.

/*QUESTION 3**/
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

forks are only used by GitHub, it is similar to cloning but you can either edit files
remotely or download a copy to your local computer. you can also allow other to collaborate
with you even though the initial project might it have not been yours.
clones is the term use in local machines when  making a copy of a repository. If the program
it's a bit complicated to work on GitHub you can simply download it and work on it in your
favorite application.
branches are form every time a commitment happens. it helps the team keep track of changes 
and features being work by everyone.
